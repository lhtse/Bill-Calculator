# The Bill Calculator
The JavaFX program simulates a restaurant environment and allows the user (a waiter)
to calculate a bill for a table. 

# <h2> Installation 
You can use the application by executing the .jar file found in the "executables" folder. There are other methods for running the program in that folder too. 

# <h2> Usage (A How-To)
To use the application, enter a valid name and table number (1-10).
Menu items can be added to the list view via the drop down menus. The total is updated as more menu items are added to the list view. 
To remove a menu item, simply click on the respective item in the list view.
