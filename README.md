# Bill-Calculator
Please note that I created this application using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2016.2.5 to gain familiarity with JavaFX.
The JavaFX program simulates a restaurant environment and allows the user (a waiter)
to calculate a bill for a table. 

# <h2> Installation
The application is locally executable by the .jar file found in the "out" folder. Other methods of running the program can be found in the folder. 

# <h2> Usage
To use the application, enter a valid name and table number (1-10).

Menu items can be added to the list view via the drop down menus. The total is updated as more menu items are added to the list view. 

To remove a menu item, simply click on the respective item in the list view.
